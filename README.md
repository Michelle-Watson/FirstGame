# Hangman Adventures: A Love Story in Beta
This is the first game I coded for my Introduction to Computer Science course in 2016.
Looking back, I can see how much I've learned over the years. But I still remember the joy of creating my first game. I hope to edit it to incorporate the software principles I've learned since then.
My documentation pdf shows my path to creating this game, providing updates almost daily until its completion.
